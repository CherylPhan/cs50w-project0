                <p class="lead"> Hi, I’m teacher Sloth.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I'm a free lance English teacher. My English was self-taught and I <strong>unintentionally</strong> 
                    reach advanced level in 3 years without much effort. I use English with correct 
                    grammar and pronunciation as any well educated English user. My English may not 
                    be perfect, but it's constantly getting  better as I use it on a daily basis.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">After an unexpected event where I had to help my younger cousins with their English 
                    abilities (they were totally beginners despite all the English lessons at their 
                    school in many years), I figured out I could help many English learners, which never 
                    succeeded with any courses they've attended or any methods they've tried, to <strong>start 
                    everything from scratch</strong> once again, and this time, with high probability of success.
                    </p>
                <p class="text-justify">So, after comfortably reading, writing, listening and speaking English for all these 
                    years, I started putting my mind into watching my “learning” process (which actually 
                    does not look like learning at all) to create a <strong>modified, better designed</strong> version of 
                    the path I've walked on, so that my students can have a better experience and faster 
                    results leading the same path. That’s how <span class="brand">LAZY ENGLISH</span> was born.
